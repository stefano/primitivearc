The aim of this project is to write a super-simple compiler for a subset of Arc
targeting the Parrot virtual machine. 

Roadmap:

* Runtime 
  * Implement basic datatypes:
    * t and nil -- done
    * Cons cells -- done
    * Symbols -- done
    * Tagged types -- done
    * Strings, numbers, functions, hash tables and continuations 
      are already built-in 
  * Operations on basic datatypes:
    * car, cdr, cons, list -- done
    * symbol table and intern -- done
    * rep and annotate -- done
  * Call table
    * call table infrastructure
    * dispatch on type of element in function position
    * defcall
* Reader
* Compiler

To build and run primitivearc you need a working copy of Parrot
and Arc3 (needed only during the installation phase).

First, configure:

  $ perl Configure.pl

Then compile the base system:

  $ make all

Now you need to compile the compiler (WARNING: this step opens an Arc REPL on port 4321):

  $ cd <arc3-directory>
  $ cp -r <primitivearc-directory>/compiler test_serv.arc .
  $ ./srv.sh
  arc> (load "test_serv.arc")

Leave the process running in the background and go back to the
primitivearc directory:

  $ cd <primitivearc-directory>
  $ ./bootstrap.sh

If you wish, you can test it:

  $ make test

Now you can kill the Arc3 process running in the background and
proceed with the last installation step:

  $ make install

Finally you can start the executable. Use the '-e' option to get a prompt
into the interactive mode:

  $ primitivearc -e
  arc>

You can also use primitivearc without installing it:

  $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=src/ops:src/pmc ./primitivearc -e
  arc>
